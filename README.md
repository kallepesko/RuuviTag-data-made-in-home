# RuuviTag-data-made-in-home
Working with RuuviTag data which is collected from my home.

You can read more about my RuuviTag -project in my student [pages](https://student.labranet.jamk.fi/~aa5348/Iot_johdanto/Iot-projekti.html)... *Ou shit! Se on suomea!*...

### Short description of my project.

I made Iot-project related to my studies in the end of 2022.

I have three RuuviTag sensors collecting data into influxdb which is running in RaspberryPi 4.

Data has been collected for a year now and it's time to look at what kind of temperature, humidity and air pressure values have been in my home in 2023.

This data analytics project tries to adapt the crisp-dm model where applicable because that is something what I have learned in my studies...

At first I try to understant and preprocess data. After that, the data is analyzed. Although I don't have any other goals, I hope to learn something new about the climate of my house.

Hope you enjoy!
